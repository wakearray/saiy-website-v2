          Saiy Android Privacy Policy
        </h1>
        <div class="policy_text">
          <p>
            As an individual developer, I am keen to make my privacy policy as clear as possible to you, without it being diluted with corporate disclaimers, that we are all used to, but rarely digest. The application requires a lot of permission to run to its full potential and I am extremely conscious of your privacy in these events and using your data responsibly - where 'responsibly' is an alternate term for 'how you would expect'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you digest the details below, allow me to give you some examples of how your permissions and data are used within commands:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Call a contact</strong> - The application searches your contact list for the required contact and number and automatically dials the number. Your contact list is not used remotely. Obviously, no calls are placed unless you specifically request the application to do so. This applies to sending text messages at your request too.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Request the weather forecast</strong> - Your current, precise location is used as a parameter to an external company, so they may return the weather details. The application does not store your location. The external company may indeed save the location data of the request for analytical purposes, but this is not identifiable to you as an individual.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>I've parked my car</strong> - Your current, precise location will be stored locally on the device, in order to retrieve when you request the location of your vehicle at a later date.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Navigate to an address</strong> - Whilst we do not store the address you requested, the address sent to your default navigation application may be stored as part of their history, for when you return to the application.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I hope the above examples put you at ease as to how I responsibly manage your data and do not collect or store information that is unnecessary to provide a service to you. Please read on where things get a little more wordy...
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than for the reasons stated below<sup>1</sup>, we do not externally collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, we do not collect or store information such as your name, address, phone number or email address, anywhere other than on your device<sup>2</sup>.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <sup>1</sup> Should you make a purchase via the in-app-billing, your email with be stored externally, along with the purchase information for administration reasons.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <sup>2</sup> Should you create a user account and choose to identify yourself in such a way.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In serving you, we may use or store your precise geographic location, if you give us permission to do so. We do not use or share this data for any other purpose. Many devices will indicate through an icon when location services are operating. We only share this location information with others as approved by you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies, unless with your express consent, they are an identifier in which you have selected for your data to be managed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the application connects or passes data (on your device) to other third-party applications, we are not responsible for their continued usage of such information. Please refer to the specific application's individual privacy policy to understand how your device and personal data is collected, managed and shared. This includes your voice data, both analysed and spoken, by third party applications and companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for the content of any external applications, web searches or websites that our application may pass data to, or refer to, either in the form of a suggested link or direct association.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand how usage of our application may be used for targeted advertising, please check your settings in the Google Play Application, under Google AdMob Ads, for your Android Platform preferences. These individual preferences may allow Google to access the information collected by our application regardless of our individual privacy policy terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, you should consult your Google Services privacy policy, to ensure any preferences concerned with your Android device are suitable to you and are not conflicting with any other individual application privacy policies, such as ours, which may be ignored as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            When requesting ads be served to you, your date of birth and gender may be disclosed, purely for the purposes of advertising relevance. These parameters are anonymous, notwithstanding the above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your voice data and usage statistics) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf in order to improve our service to you. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take steps following the Android Developer Guidelines to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. No security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.
          </p>
          <p>
            To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances:
            <ol>
              <li>With your express consent.</li>
              <li>When we have a good faith belief it is required by law.</li>
              <li>When we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property.</li>
              <li>To any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets.</li>                
            </ol>
            Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Application Permissions</strong>: The application requires many permissions in order to function as you would expect. By accepting these permissions from within the application, we do not store the accessible data remotely, neither do you give us permission to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Voice Recognition & Permanent Listening:</strong> A recording of the last few seconds of audio will be analysed to identify and process your commands. This recorded audio may be shared with any of the Voice Recognition Providers, in order to transcript the audio captured into words. The audio capture is not stored locally on the device. If you do not understand or are unclear on the contents of this privacy policy, please uninstall the application immediately in the usual way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Anonymous Usage Statistics:</strong> In order to improve your experience and that of others, anonymous usage data is collected whilst you are using the application. Such information may contain the particular command you attempted, how it was requested and if it resulted in a success or failure. This will help to identify any potential errors negative to the workings of the application. In addition, the time you spent in various parts of the application user interface, which again, are not identifiable individually to you.
